# As We Learn: A Manifesto

1. __We write things down as we learn them.__ 
2. __We edit constantly, as we learn of new and better ways to do things.__ We replace the parts that turn out to be wrong.
3. __Everything is always a work-in-progress.__ We write living documents that improve with our understanding of the subject.
